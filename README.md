###2. Run the server
In the same terminal (or a new one):

java server.Server

The server will start and wait for clients.

###3. Run the client
Open another terminal window and run:

java client.Client

You’ll see a prompt from the server asking for a command.

###4. Commands on Client
UPLOAD → Upload a file to the server. It will ask for the file path.

DOWNLOAD → Download a file from the server. It will ask for the file name.

Downloaded files are saved in the client directory with the prefix downloaded_.

Always start the server before running any client.
